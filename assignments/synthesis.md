## Introduction

We’ve spent 7-weeks in iterative investigations of Mars, materials, inflatable structures, close-loop systems, managing plant groups and, public engagement and poetic gestures. This exercise will draw together students in ‘Building an Atmosphere’ and ‘Responsive Mobile Environments’ to reflect on what we’ve learned so far and integrate solutions, opportunities and questions into a unified proposal for the habitat we should build. 

This two-week exploration will form two large collaborative teams across BAA and RME to develop two well realized proposals which will be presented to a panel of internal and external guests during the Mid-term Review. This feedback will lead towards an eventual synthesis of all design team ideas into a single proposal for a full scale prototype that blends architecture and technology interventions.

## Brief: 

Review the design investigations to date and develop an integrated proposal for a Martian habitat that can sustain plants. This proposal should develop the design for a) a Mars Theoretical Habitat and b) an Earth Analogue Habitat. 

The proposal should:

* represents the geometry of the design for Mars

* represent materials and structures that are suitable for the Martian environment

* consider a collapsible structure fitting inside the payload of the SLS/Falcon Heavy

* sustain plant occupants

* be closed-loop

* not require external power sources

* propose technology solutions to support plant life, adapt the interior conditions, and for mission coordination/communication

* address public engagement with the habitat.

* explore adaptations needed for an Earth Analogue

## Milestones: 


* **_Friday March 4th - Internal Review_**

* **_Friday March 18th - Mid-term Review (w. invited guests)_**

## Process:

In a week long charrette, two teams with combined participants from BAA and RAA will work to develop an integrated proposal for a Martian biome. 

These teams will develop, combine, and incorporate ideas and geometries from the other project working towards the development of a combined, synthesized project.

Following the break, two teams will present two options as part of a Midterm Review.

## Deliverables: 

#### 1. Well developed proposal for a Martian biome that integrates architecture, technology and other multidisciplinary knowledge. This proposal will include:

* vision statement 

* models/renderings of the proposed habitat (interior/exterior)

* architectural plan 

* materials and design descriptions

* technology and hardware requirements

* system specifications (functional proposals for embedded technology)

* needs assessment and open questions

* relevant prototypes, physical mockups, etc. 

* project management proposal (responsibilities, organization, etc.)

* timeline for the development of the earth analog

* itemised bill of materials

#### 2. A digital presentation

*Two proposals presented for a max of __15 minutes each__ with 20 minutes for comment by the invited guests.*

It should:

* demonstrate how the design geometry responds to Martian conditions

* demonstrate the design in both collapsed and expanded form

* includes construction details 

* places this project within the history of space habitats/vehicle design

* demonstrates how the technical systems respond to Martian conditions

* demonstrates how the technical systems adapt the interior conditions and sustain plant-life within the timespan of a proposed mission to Mars.

* places this project within the history of technical systems for plant growth and for space exploration

* explains the significance of this design in both space exploration and human interaction on Earth

* explore the integration of multidisciplinary knowledge and approaches

* describe the timeline, organization and management required to implement an earth analog prototype by end of semester.
