## Overview and objectives

The course will be very collaborative and highly interdisciplinary. Students from all over the CMU campus will be taking part in both courses. So, it’s important we get to know each other, as well as the backgrounds, goals, the skills and interests each of us have.  This project will challenge you to: 

* Clearly communicate your skills and interests to other participants of the course;

* Develop an understanding the skills and abilities of potential collaborators in the course and how they compliment your skills. 

* Develop an understanding of the range of disciplines and interests in the class, as well as how they contribute to exploring Martian habitats. 

The goal of this exercise will be introduce yourself to the other students in the course **_with a 1-minute video._**

2. What’s an example of something you’ve made/analyzed/explored that relates to this class?

3. What are your unique skills that will help you in building a Martian habitat? 

4. What are the images/ideas/concepts about space exploration that you love?
