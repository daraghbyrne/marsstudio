## Introduction

You will have most of the second half of the semester to construct the prototype. The organization of schedules, build time, and delegation of tasks will be accomplished by the student teams. 

## Brief: Build a full scale prototype of the Martian habitat and deploy it to the CFA lawn. 

The physical prototype should 

* represents the geometry of the design for Mars

* a collapsible structure fitting inside the payload of the SLS/Falcon Heavy

* sustains plant occupants

* does not require external power sources

* have working embedded technology and systems to support plant life, adapt the interior conditions, mission coordination and communication and public engagement

## Process:

Students from both ‘Building an Atmosphere’ and ‘Responsive Mobile Environments’ will work collaboratively to prepare an integrated prototype. 

All students will document their work regularly. 

Tuesday and Friday class sessions will be used for build time, team meetings and desk crits.

Before class on Friday, students will post a short weekly update (see below).

## Milestones: 

* *Weekly (Friday)* - Progress update.

* *Friday Apr 22: Pre-Final Review and Soft Opening* - Students will deploy the prototype and engage with guests from NASA in discussing their work to date

* Tuesday May 3: Final Review (TBC)

## Deliverables: 

* A deployed and working prototype 

* A digital presentation of your work 

* Digital Documentation of the final outcome

#### Weekly Documentation Requirements:

Each team should post a short status update to Slack before Friday’s class. 

This should be about 200 words and cover: 

1. Design/build work and activities undertaken

2. Challenges Encountered / Open Questions

3. Next steps

The post should include media and illustrative content. 

#### Final Documentation Requirements: 

High quality documentation of the final prototype including photos, videos, code, design documents, etc. should be posted to the IDeATe Gallery.

Each team should also include a summary of their contributions and their process (200-300 word + media) for each team. 

#### Digital Presentation

Should:

* demonstrates how the design geometry responds to Martian conditions

* demonstrates the design in both collapsed and expanded form

* includes construction details and cut sheets

* places this project within the history of space habitats/vehicle design

* demonstrates how the technical systems respond to Martian conditions

* demonstrates how the technical systems adapt the interior conditions and sustain plant-life within the timespan of a proposed mission to Mars.

* places this project within the history of technical systems for plant growth and for space exploration

* explains the significance of this design in both space exploration and human interaction on Earth

* describes the process
