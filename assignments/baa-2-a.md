## Overview

Over the course of the next six weeks, you will iteratively:

- research the environmental conditions of Mars
- design an appropriate geometric and material response to those conditions analyze your geometry with physics and engineering tools
- document your design incorporating documentation tools from all the disciplines prototype a physical mockup of your geometry

Your design must meet the following constraints:

- an air tight envelope capable of handling pressure differential
- a collapsible structure fitting inside the payload of the SLS/Falcon Heavy
- considers both plant occupants and human remote interaction
- demonstrates the capacity of your geometry to respond to a Mars environmental condition within the system your team is investigating

Each week your presentation will be 10 minutes: 5 minutes presentation, plus 5 minutes critique.

## [2A] Pressure Vessels & Material Experimentation

* Begin to research the Martian environment related to your system
* Experiment with variable density liquids and air in alternative materials to develop unique geometries derived from basic physics and material principles
* Incorporate Grasshopper Physics tools to help your documentation
* Each group member develop a documentation language and start to see how your documentation languages start to overlap or can be combined
* Experiment with the creation of a physical representation of your geometry

#### Due: Tuesday Jan-26th

## Deliverables

These documents will not be new each time, but rather evolutionary documents that are built upon and revised with each iteration.

####  1. Digital Presentation on the Martian conditions you are investigating and responding to

#### 2. 36 X 48 Panel documenting your geometry

- MUST include a combined method of documentation from each discipline including properties of physics, material, and environmental factors
- MUST describe/diagram its performative properties as per your system question
- MUST include the object in both the collapsed and inflated state
- MUST indicate the pressure boundary and network diagram

#### 3. Physical Prototype representing your geometry

and supporting documentation of the physical prototype, including:
- construction details
- inflatable cutsheet
