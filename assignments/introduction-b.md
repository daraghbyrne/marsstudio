## Overview and objectives

* Investigate the environment of Mars and develop a 1-page summary of research

* Come up with a series of questions and problem statements related to the idea of creating a human or plant habitable atmosphere on Mars. 

* Based on your research, what are the base conditions we have to address?

##  Research the Space/Martian Environment

**Due: Tuesday, January 19, 10.30am**

### Brief:

Each team will take on one of the following systems:

					

**BAA** 

* Sunlight (Visible and Radiation)

* Protection from Mars (Wind, Dust, CO2 frost, Seasonal Changes) 

* Protection of Mars (Redundancy, Containment, Robustness) 

* Water (Sourcing and Circulation)

					

**RME**

* Plants (Suitability, Oxygenation, Scale and Lifecycle)

* Adaptation to Environmental Conditions

* Energy (Dependence, Harvesting, Collection, Production, Need) 

* Control & Communication (Remoteness, Noise, Reliability, Delay)



In your teams, begin to research the Mars conditions pertinent to your system. Discuss and identify the questions/problems that your system will need to address and how these conditions will affect plant occupants and human remote interaction. Consider the conditions in the next assignments, and what other questions you seek to answer throughout the semester. We will revisit these questions in week 8.

Some issues might include:

* scale of habitat

* scale, type, and number of plants

* pressure differential

* rate of plant oxygen respiration/production

* artificial v natural light for plant growth

* scale, type, and number of plants redundancy

* relationship of habitat to earthâ€™

* redundancy and reliability

* materials, components and technical systems suitable for mars

Print or Write these questions out on post-its / cards / pieces of paper. On Tuesday Jan 19 we will share these questions with each other, narrow, and identify which are necessary for further exploration, and separate into project teams with particular focus. 


**Due: Tuesday, January 19, 10.30am**

#### Deliverables:

* A 1-page summary of research (include links and sources used)

* List of questions and research topics of interest concerning both:

  * *Mars Theoretical Habitat*

  * *Earth Analogue Habitat*

#### Submitting your work:

1. Share your research outcomes and questions to slack as a new Post to the [#projects](https://mars-studio.slack.com/messages/projects/) channel on slack.

2. Print each question to be printed out on half of a letter size sheet of paper and bring to class.
