## Overview 

We've spent an entire semester thinking about, researching, analyzing, investigating and building structures and technologies to support and sustain plants on Mars. We've done this as a massive collaboration of 30+ students from across the CMU campus and with the input, time and consideration of dozens of faculty and external experts. As part of this exercise, we'd like you to share your experience of this course, review the investigations and explorations we've conducted and the challenges, opportunities and potential for Mars exploration we've uncovered.

> #  ‘Why should we go to Mars?’

#### Brief


Create a video (up to 3 minutes) that addresses this question.

Share your personal experience in this course and aspirations for the future of Mars exploration.

Reflect on your experiences of building a habitat for plants on Mars, and on the outcomes and interactions you’ve had as part of this course.

Talk about what's next for you and for Mars exploration. 

**Due:** Friday May 3rd, 9pm

#### Submitting your work:

1. Upload your video to Vimeo (**hard requirement**)

2. Post the video to the [#introductions](https://mars-studio.slack.com/messages/introductions/) channel on slack.

3. We’ll compile the videos into a playlist for the group to be viewed together.


#### Think about

When preparing your video, below are some questions you might think about: 

- Review the process of designing a Martian habitat (what ideas did you uncover by making prototypes?; how did these prototypes reveal possibilities or get integrated into the final structure?);
- Talk about what you learned as part of this course;
- Talk about the collaborative experience as part of this course;
- How has your perspective on goign to Mars changed as a result of this course?
- Are you more or less excited about Mars exploration now?
- What are you most proud of? 
- Share your thoughts on the challenges, opportunities and potential of designing technology solutions for space exploration and habitation?;
- Describe your understanding of the process of designing and developing extra-planetary technology/space;
- Explore the unresolved questions you encountered in your investigations and application in the studio;
- What excites you now about Mars and mars exploration? 
- Look to the future: __what’s next for you or for Mars?__


#### Content 

- Bring in footage/images from your assignments and outcomes. 
- Draw on images/ideas/concepts about space exploration that you love;
- Draw on footage from movies or TV that show Mars


####  Preparing a Video a.k.a How do I this?

You can sketch it, draw it, design it, record it, rip and edit it, or combine all these mediums, in a way that creates a compelling video. 

* *Recommended Video Editing Software:* Adobe After Effects (download a[ free trial](http://www.adobe.com/downloads.html)), iMovie, Final Cut Pro (download a[ free trial](http://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/trial/)) - these are also available on the IDeATe laptops. 

* Downloading Video Sources: KeepVid ([http://keepvid.com/](http://keepvid.com/))

* Video Compression: ClimpChamp ([https://clipchamp.com/](https://clipchamp.com/))

#### Capturing Video:

* Your smartphone is an awesome video camera or use the webcam in your laptop/tablet! 

* DSLRs are available from the IDeATe Lending pool (Hunt Basement) and have video recording capabilities. There’s also some Yeti USB mic’s for doing voice overs.
